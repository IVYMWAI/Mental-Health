# Mental Health: Machine Learning Project on Indicators of Anxiety and Depression

## Welcome
In this project, we aim to develop a machine learning model to detect and analyze indicators of anxiety and depression based on reported frequencies of symptoms. Mental health issues are a significant concern, and early detection and intervention can be crucial. Indicators of anxiety or Depression Based on reported frequency of symptoms. This is a project that will involve data analysis on how anxiety and depression indicators vary across different demographic groups,states,time period and machine learning algorithms to help build predictive models that will provide a reliable methodology that can be designed to identify individuals who are at risk of falling into depression and refer them to pyschiatrists.

This project has been motivated by the #World mental Health Day which is celebrated every 10th of October everyyear.

According to WHO(World Health Organization),depression is one of the leading causes of disability with suicide being the fourth leading cause of death among 15-29-year-olds. However,in 2019,WHO launched the WHO Special Initiative for Mental Health (2019-2023): Universal Health Coverage for Mental Health to ensure access to quality and affordable care for mental health conditions in 12 priority countries to 100 million more people

## Dataset

We will be using a dataset that contains information about reported symptoms and their frequencies from individuals. The dataset to be used in this project was collected from DATA.GOV,here is the link(https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/indicators-of-anxiety-or-depression-based-on-reported-frequency-of-symptoms-during-last-7).

The survey was conducted to gauge the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on employment status, consumer spending, food security, housing, education disruptions, and dimensions of physical and mental wellness.

## Questions to answer

1.What are the types of mental health disorder that people around the world suffer? 
2.How many people in each country have symptoms of depressive and anxiety disorder.
3.which subgroup is likely to have symptoms of anxiety and depression?
4.In which age subgroups is depression more common? 5

## Project Objectives

The main objectives of this project include:

1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for machine learning.
2.Exploratory data analysis to explore relationships between variables.
3.Hypotheses testing to identify variables that are significantly associated wuth symptoms of depressive and anxiety disorders.
4.Feature Engineering: Extracting relevant features from the data.
5.Model Development: Creating machine learning models to predict indicators of anxiety and depression.
6.Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance through appropriate metrics.
7.Interpretability: Understanding the importance of various features in the prediction.
8.Visualization: Visualizing the results and insights.


## Methodology

I plan to use various machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks, to build predictive models. Additionally, I will employ techniques like cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and feature selection to optimize model performance.

## Conclusion

This project aims to provide a valuable contribution to mental health research by developing a reliable and interpretable machine learning model for identifying indicators of anxiety and depression. By better understanding and early detection of these conditions, we hope to make a positive impact on mental health awareness and support.
